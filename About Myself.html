                <h1>About Myself</h1>   
                <p><bold>My name is Johann Ludwig Van R. Nicolas</bold></p>  
                <p>I'm 21 years Old</p>
                <p>I'm from Baranggay Maligaya, San Miguel Tarlac City</p> 
                <p>This introduction should give you a glimpse of what kind of personally I had.<br>
                    When we are living in a world dominated by self-interest and inhospitable, I find the only way to ease myself is by putting the happiness of others first. There is an indescribable happiness that can be achieved when I can see somebody's smiling eyes resulting from something I did to them. I know that I have made a positive impact in their lives and happy moments. Whether it is to offer someone an ear to listen to them in times of turmoil or only comfort by a hug when they need it most, I donâ€™t matter my own personal needs to see them happy. These kids above all taught me the meaning of smiling, happiness, and being at peace and I learned the real meaning of compassion and sacrifice from them. Undoubtedly, my path of light was shined by them. I mean, as I am taking care of someone else and making their life better by offering my physical and emotional support, I sense a depth of happiness, born from the inside and penetrating every atom of my psyche.   </p>
