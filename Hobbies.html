               <p>Playing piano is like discovering the inner peace in a soft breeze every time I play a chord. As the piano melts in my hand, every note is a whisper of calmness that wraps me in its warm embrace. An aura of peace surrounds me, and like a songbird swooping outside the window, each ivory key beneath my fingertips is a familiar melody that resonates with the deepest part of my soul, a realm where worries are left behind and serenity prevails. The next time our club hosts a music event, just know that even though I usually stay quiet and filled with intricate patterns, itâ€™s when I am joined by my friends that the music truly comes alive, their laughter and camaraderie infusing each chord with an incredible joy and full of energy that is highly contagious. Side by side, we encounter our day-to-day life in a serene atmosphere, melting and turning them into a symphony which speaks about the essence of our friendship and makes us have many joyful and beloved memories. The moment the music turns into the slow buzzing of the night I know it is time to turn on my poetry books, where the most eloquent were formed a shelter for an unrestful heart. Covered in the hues of the words, one can find a safe haven among the lines where the whole poem serves as a calm murmur reminding us that underneath the whirlwind of chaos one can find a silent home.</p>
